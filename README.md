## CarDekho Dataset Analysis
### Project Overview
This project involves an analysis of the CarDekho dataset, which contains detailed information about various cars. The objective is to explore the dataset, perform statistical analysis, and derive meaningful insights about the factors influencing car prices and other features.

### Project Description
The CarDekho dataset provides comprehensive details about cars, including features such as name, year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner. The goal of this project is to analyze these features to understand their impact on car prices and identify significant trends and patterns.

## Statistical Hypotheses
The project involves testing several statistical hypotheses, including but not limited to:

1. #### <ins> Hypothesis 1: Relationship between Car Price and Year </ins>

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between the selling price of a car and its year of manufacture.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between the selling price of a car and its year of manufacture.
2. #### <ins> Hypothesis 2: Impact of Fuel Type on Car Price </ins>

- Null Hypothesis (H0): The type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG) has no significant impact on the selling price of a car.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The type of fuel has a significant impact on the selling price of a car.
3. #### <ins> Hypothesis 3: Influence of Transmission Type on Car Price </ins>

- Null Hypothesis (H0): The transmission type (Manual, Automatic) has no significant effect on the selling price of a car.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The transmission type has a significant effect on the selling price of a car.

## Results
The analysis yielded the following results:

#### Relationship between Car Price and Year

A regression analysis indicated a significant negative relationship between the year of manufacture and the selling price, suggesting that newer cars tend to have higher selling prices.
#### Impact of Fuel Type on Car Price

An ANOVA test showed that the type of fuel significantly impacts the selling price. Specifically, cars with Diesel engines tend to have higher selling prices compared to Petrol and CNG cars.
#### Influence of Transmission Type on Car Price

The analysis revealed that transmission type significantly affects the selling price. Automatic transmission cars generally have higher selling prices compared to manual transmission cars.
